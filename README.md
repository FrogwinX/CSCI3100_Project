## Development Guideline

- Organize the files with reference to [Project Directories](#project-directories)
- Name components in _Pascal Case_ (e.g. PasswordResetForm) and routes in _Kebab Case_ (e.g. password-reset)
- Colour components by following the [colour guideline](https://daisyui.com/docs/colors/)
- Use icons from [Font Awesome Icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- Use `npm run dev` to start a development server to see real-time file changes
- Use `npm run build` to verifiy your code can be compiled under ESLint rules.
