\section{Introduction}

This document outlines the development considerations, guidelines, technical specification and design for FlowChat, an online forum web application. The app’s primary features include a user-generated forum spanning diverse topics, networking capabilities with following and messaging functionalities, and user profile and management systems.\\

Readers may skip to their section of interest. The software development model and architecture are detailed in the \textit{Guidelines and Assumptions}, and \textit{System Architecture} sections. The design and high-level details of major visual components are covered in \textit{User Interface and Frontend Component Design} section. The database structure, component communication interfaces, and backend logic are documented in the \textit{Data Model Design}, \textit{Application Programming Interface Design} and \textit{Application Programming Interface Specification} sections.

\section{Guidelines and Assumptions}

\subsection{Software Development Guidelines}
According to the Software Requirements Specification, the software project can be divided into five main features, including Account Management, Administrative Management, Personal Profile, Discussion Forum, and Direct Message. \\

All developers should follow the incremental model in the software development process, where an incremental refers to one main feature. Each incremental period adopts a simple waterfall model involving design specification, implementation, testing and delivery. All incremental periods are designed to be sequential, according to the level of importance and the software order flow. The tentative development schedule is shown below: \\

\begin{tabular}{|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.2\linewidth}|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.35\linewidth}|m{0.4\linewidth}|} \hline

     21 Mar --- 01 May & All & Integration Testing \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
All developers should pay attention to the issue boxes on GitHub KanBan. All ready-to-pick-up jobs will be assigned to some developers and available as issue boxes in the "Ready" section. Developers should move the issue box they are working on to the "In Progress" section during development. After development, the issue box should be placed in the "In Review" section for deployment and testing. After that, the issue box should be in the "Done" section.

\subsection{Documentation Assumptions}
The first version of Design Implementation Documentation will focus on the system architecture and high-level design details of features including Account Management, Discussion Forum and Direct Message. \\

The design details of features for Administrative Management and Personal Profile will be added with the software development process. All content is subject to change. \\

All low-level design implementations are documented in code. Relevant information will be listed in the Appendix for references.

\section{System Architecture}
The system architecture is designed to be a Client-Server model. The overall structure is shown below:
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{general architecture.png}

\subsection{Web Server}
The web server renders the application interface using React components, with Next.js enabling Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), routing and data fetching. TypeScript is used as the primary development language to ensure type safety and correctness.\\

Deployed on Microsoft Azure, the server defaults to CSR for most components to reduce server workload. In CSR, the client compiles the web page locally using JavaScript sent from the server. For user-generated content like posts and comments, SSR is used to pre-compile pages on the server, delivering fully-rendered HTML to the client for faster load times and improved Search Engine Optimization.\\

Data requests to the application server are primarily initiated on the client side while server-rendered components handle data requests on the server side. These requests are facilitated through application programming interfaces provided by the application server, ensuring efficient data flow between client and server.\\

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{web_server_arch.png}
\end{center}

\subsection{Application Server}
The application server is responsible for writing application programming interfaces (APIs) to provide dynamic content such as processing business logic on data and interacting with the database server, to the web server.\\

The provided dynamic content is built with a microservices architecture, in which a functional feature is divided into several independent components that run each application logic as a service, to achieve loose coupling and enhance software scalability. The microservices use RESTful APIs to communicate with frontend, in order to provide standard HTTP methods and uniform interface, and process stateless requests.\\

The application server is written in Java and deployed to Microsoft Azure. To adopt the microservices architecture and RESTful API, the Spring Boot framework is used to provide configuration initialization and program structure, which is a layered structure:\\

\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Controller: Responsible for defining the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), query parameters and request body of APIs. Wraps data into the response body in JSON format and returns it to the frontend. \\
    \item Service: Responsible for applying business logic on data processing. \\
    \item Repository: Responsible for defining SQL and query data type. The data returns from the database can be directly matched to Java data types and objects, which are defined in the Model Class.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=260pt]{backend architecture.png}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Database Server}
The database server is responsible for storing data.\\

The database type is SQL database and the server is hosted through Microsoft Azure in East Asia. The connection between application and database server is established using Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) driver with SQL authentication. The maximum storage is 2GB.

\section{User Interface and Frontend Component Design}
The User Interface (UI) and Frontend Component Design for FlowChat ensure a seamless experience using React and Next.js. The design adheres to a modular layout, ensuring consistency across pages while maintaining responsiveness for various screen sizes, with an optimal resolution of 1920x1080. The primary designs are completed using Figma. DaisyUI with a light color scheme is used to enhance accessibility and aesthetics.

\section{Data Model Design}
Data models are containers that format data for frontend-backend communication, processing, and storage.

\subsection{Communication Model}
The data format in the application programming interfaces is the JSON format. When requesting and responsing resources from the backend, it is used in the request body and response body. \\

In the request body, there is no general data model. All JSON keys must be set according to the specifications of each API. \\

In the response body, the general JSON format always starts with two pairs of keys/values "message" and "data". For each successful API response, the "message" indicates the work done, and the "data" is the actual information returned from the application server. See the following example: 

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true, frame=single]
{
    "message": "Password is reset",
    "data": {
        "username": edwinlamtk,
        "isSuccess": true
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\smallskip
For each expected exception that occurred in the application server, the boolean value with the key "isXXX" is set to false, and the values of other keys are set to null. See the following example: 

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true, frame=single]
{
    "message": "Key is not available",
    "data": {
        "isSuccess": false,
        "username": null
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\smallskip
For each unexpected exception that occurred in the application server, the "message" is replaced by Java Exception Message, and the value of "data" is set to null. See the following example: 

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true, frame=single]
{
    "message": "Fail: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero",
    "data": null
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Database Schema}
The database schema describes the data attributes, data types and the entity relationships in the database.
\subsubsection{Account Management (Built)}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=250pt]{account management database schema.png}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Discussion Forum}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=400pt]{discussion forum database schema.png}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Direct Message}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{direct message database schema.pdf}
\end{center}

\section{Application Programming Interface Design}
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are the essential communication channel for frontend applications to communicate with backend applications. It specifies the application data input, expected data flows and exceptions, and data output. In the following, the overall data flowchart diagrams and each API design corresponding to feature requirements are presented. For detailed specification and expected exceptions, please see Section \ref{sec:api_spec}.

\subsection{Account Management (Deployed)}

    unreadMessageCountFromEachUser}
\end{itemize}



\section{Backend Component Design}
In backend, the components are mainly controller, service, repository and data model Java classes. Components are managed using Object-Oriented Programming, in which the features of encapsulation and abstraction are highly adopted. It is suggested that not to define and couple any complex relationship of objects using the features of inheritance and polymorphism.\\

Data model classes are defined with object attributes matched with database entity attributes. All the access modifiers of attributes should be "private" and encapsulated by auto getter and setter methods. \\

Repository classes are interfaces extending from JpaRepository, allowing executions of SQL commands by calling the abstraction methods. \\

Controller classes are responsible for converting data in JSON format to Java Objects, passing them to service classes. The processed Java Objects in service classes return back to controller classes for converting back to JSON format. With the Inversion of Control principle in the Spring framework, the loosely coupled object relationship can be further achieved by injecting the dependency of service classes to controller classes. \\

The low level component designs for each functional feature are described by the following class diagrams. The detailed specification of component functions are written in the JavaDoc Comments. When the functions are finalized, they will be listed in the Appendix for references.
